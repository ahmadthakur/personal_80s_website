# Is Authentic Reality really necessary to experience Life?

*13-10-2024*

The *brain in a vat* is a thought experiment that argues that we could be brains in a vat hooked to a computer and our entire perception of reality could just be a simulation. But why does it matter if our experiences are real or not as long as we are happy? The ancient Greeks emphasized the end goal of life to attain happiness, which is why they came up with philosophy, ethics and humanities, ways to make a human live a good and happy existence. If a simulation allows a person to *live* a good and happy existence would it really matter? 

The thought experience itself argues that we couldn't possibly know if we're already living in a simulation. But I guess an argument about personal choice comes into the equation. We don't know if we are in a simulation or not because we didn't enter the simulation by our own will. But if we knew, we wouldn't have in the first place. Just like how in the movie, the Matrix, once Morpheus wakes up people from the Matrix, they don't feel like going back into it, no matter how bad the real world is. Does that mean, if we are put in a simulation without our knowledge then it would be fine?

Our reality has already been changed right before our very eyes. In our daily lives we depend so much on technology. Technology that we do not need to survive but that we definitely need to live. We as a society actively made a choice to change our reality into this. Spending hours of our waking day on the internet. Interacting with the world through a 6-inch screen. There are entire corporations setup to maintain this facade. We don't own things now. We buy or subscribe to digital goods, that are as real as the Steak Cypher enjoys in the Matrix. 

So if we just add some more experiences to the list of ever-growing digital experiences, why would it matter? Why do people think that these experiences would be somehow less or that we would lose what it means to be human? If anything it would make us happier by solving a lot of problems, like the housing crises. You don't need a house if you are just a brain in jar.
