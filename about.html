          My name is Ahmad Thakur. I grew up in Lahore, where I have endured the
          last 25 years of my existence. I am a recent Software Engineering
          graduate with no passion for programming anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have no idea what to do now so I have started studying philosophy
          and psychology. It's definitely not because of the various leftist
          trans and bisexual video essayists I have come across on YouTube. I
          want to know why people are the way they are, what makes them tick and
          what makes them happy. And especially, what would make
          <em>me</em> happy.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've started writing about things I learn and my thoughts on them. I
          have put some of my thoughts here for the eyes of any random traveller
          that happens to come across this website.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also make music when I fee like it. I get random bursts of creative
          spark, and when I do, I usually avoid every other adult responsibilty
          to just create stuff. I would like to remain in this state of mind
          24/7, 365 days of the year, but alas, life is not that simple. Which is
          why I've started studying philosophy, to make sense of this complicated life.
          You can visit my
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ahmad_thakur">YouTube</a>
          to hear me talk about random stuff.
