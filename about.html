        <p>
          My name is Ahmad Thakur! I grew up in Lahore and have spent the last
          25 years navigating the ups and downs of life in this city. I recently
          graduated with a degree in Software Engineering, though my passion for
          programming has slowly faded away like a dying sunset.
        </p>
        <p>
          These days, I’m diving deep into philosophy and psychology to better
          understand why people are the way they are, what drives them, and what
          truly brings happiness—not just for others, but for myself as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside my studies, I’m also working as Territory Leader at
          <a href="https://www.aspireleaders.org/">Aspire Institute</a>, where I
          help young people build leadership skills, discover new career
          opportunities, and connect with mentors who can guide them toward a
          brighter future. It’s a role that allows me to help others while I
          continue to explore my own path.
        </p>
        <p>
          I write about the things I’m learning and my reflections along the
          way, sharing them here for any random traveler who stumbles upon this
          website. If you’d like to hear more of my thoughts, feel free to visit
          my
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ahmad_thakur">YouTube channel</a>,
          where I share my thoghts on a variety of topics.
